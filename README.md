ATM Interface (Java GUI)
Overview
The ATM Interface is a Java-based application designed to simulate a simple ATM system. The system allows users to interact with their bank account through an ATM machine interface, which supports basic operations such as withdrawing money, depositing funds, and checking account balance.

This project uses JavaFX to create a user-friendly GUI and demonstrates object-oriented concepts by having two main classes: the ATM machine and the User's Bank Account. The ATM machine interacts with the user's bank account to perform transactions, and the user can visually see the results of each action.

Features
ATM Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the ATM for various banking operations.
Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their bank account, with checks to ensure the balance is sufficient.
Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their bank account.
Check Balance: Users can view their current bank account balance.
Transaction Validation: Ensures that withdrawals do not exceed the available balance, and inputs are valid.
Bank Account Management: The program maintains a class for the userâ€™s bank account, which stores and modifies the balance.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
JavaFX: Framework for building the GUI interface.
VS Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.
JavaFX SDK: Required for running JavaFX-based applications.
